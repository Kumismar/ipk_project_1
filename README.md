# IPK project 1

Client implementation of [IPK Calculator Protocol](https://git.fit.vutbr.cz/NESFIT/IPK-Projekty/src/branch/master/Project%201/Protocol.md) for IPK course at FIT BUT. 

Please note that the code doesn't work without the server (but you can make your own if you're brave enough). 

If you want to run tests, compilethe project with `make`, compile test files with `make test` and run it with `make runtest` (all of them in project root); dont't forget to `make clean` so you won't leave a mess. 

Final evaluation: 16/20; mostly documentation and bibliography issues (you don't have to search for it in this repo, it's not here).

## For FIT students that came for an inspiration
Feel free to be inspired by the source files as much as you like but remember, anything too much is bad.
