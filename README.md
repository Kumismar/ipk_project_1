# ipk_project_1

Client for server calculator for IPK course at FIT BUT. 

Please note that the code doesn't work without the server (but you can make your own if you're brave enough). 

If you'd like to try tests and don't have system-wide Google-test library installed, then write your own Makefile. If you have Google-test library installed, don't forget to provide full path to my Makefile and the you can run `make test` which compiles the tests and `make runtest` which runs the tests. 

Final evaluation: 16/20; mostly documentation and bibliography issues (you don't have to search for it in this repo, it's not here).

## For FIT students that came for an inspiration
Feel free to be inspired by the source files as much as you like but remember, anything too much is bad.
